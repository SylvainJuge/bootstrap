-- things to experiment with tests --

- try with resources
- try/catch with multiple exceptions thrown
    -> catch an exception and throw another in finally block
    -> we should be able to get "lost" exception through API
- new filesystem api
    -> common filesystem operations
        -> create file/folder
        -> delete file/folder
        -> read/write files
    -> explore the filesystem
    -> define hooks for filesystem events
    -> create a virtual filesystem
- fork/join
